Learning "Matplotlib" library


Matplotlib is a popular Python library for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations in data analysis, data science, and scientific computing. 
It provides a wide range of tools and functions for producing high-quality plots and charts.

- Installation : **pip install matplotlib**
- Basic Plot: To create a basic plot, you can use the **pyplot** module, which is usually imported as "plt". 
- Customizing Plots: Matplotlib provides a wide range of customization options, allowing you to control the appearance of your plots, such as colors, markers, labels, legends, and more.
- Types of Plots:Matplotlib supports various types of plots, including line plots, bar plots, scatter plots, histograms, box plots, and more. You can choose the type of plot that best suits your data and visualization needs.
- Subplots: You can create multiple subplots within a single figure using **plt.subplot()** or plt.subplots(). Subplots are helpful when you want to display multiple plots in one figure.
- Saving Plots: You can save your plots as image files (e.g., PNG, JPEG, PDF) using **plt.savefig()**.
- Working with Multiple Figures: You can work with multiple figures and control their properties using **plt.figure()**. This is useful when you want to create multiple independent plots.
- Advanced Features: Matplotlib offers more advanced features, such as 3D plotting, polar plots, and geographical mapping, through specialized toolkits and functions.
   "from mpl_toolkits.mplot3d import Axes3D"
- Using Styles: Matplotlib allows you to use predefined styles to customize the appearance of your plots easily.
      eg)plt.style.use('ggplot')
- Interactive and Animated Plots: Matplotlib can be used with other libraries like **mpl_toolkits.basemap** for geographic data or with animation libraries like **matplotlib.animation** for creating dynamic and animated plots.
